Sherlock
========

_Sherlock_ is a PHP (>=5.3.0) client for [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/).  _Sherlock_ can be used to search and manage ElasticSearch clusters.

Features
--------

 - One-to-one mapping with ElasticSearch's API and query DSL.
 - Option to use powerful ORM-like interface, associative arrays or raw JSON
 - Application-wide connection pooling with HTTP/1.1 persistent connections (using a single [cURL multi-handle in Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org/tour/http.html#managed-persistent-http-connections))
 - Autodetection of cluster nodes and subsequent round-robin requests to the entire cluster
 - Configurable logging capabilities

Installation via Composer
-------------------------
The recommended method to install _Sherlock_ is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

1. Add ``sherlock/sherlock`` as a dependency in your project's ``composer.json`` file:

        {
            "require": {
                "sherlock/sherlock": "0.1.*"
            }
        }

   *Note*: If you would like to use the latest stable development version, specify ``dev-master`` in your composer file instead of ``0.1.*``.  Master is kept at the most recent, stable development version but may not be tagged and pushed to Packagist yet.  Unstable dev versions are kept secluded in the ``develop`` branch.

2. Download and install Composer:

        curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

3. Install your dependencies:

        php composer.phar install

4. Require Composer's autoloader

    Composer also prepares an autoload file that's capable of autoloading all of the classes in any of the libraries that it downloads. To use it, just add the following line to your code's bootstrap process:

        <?php
        require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and other best-practices for defining dependencies at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org).


Manual Installation
-------------------
_Sherlock_ can be installed even if you don't use Composer.  Download Sherlock and include the following in your index.php or equivalent

```php
        <?php
        require 'Sherlock/Sherlock.php';
        \Sherlock\Sherlock::registerAutoloader();
```

Usage
-----
The library interface is still under flux...this section will be updated once _Sherlock_ has been fleshed out a bit more.

```php
   require 'vendor/autoload.php';

   //The Sherlock object manages cluster state, builds queries, etc
   $sherlock = new Sherlock();

   //Add a node to our cluster.  Sherlock can optionally autodetect nodes given one starting seed
   $sherlock->addNode('localhost', 9200);

   //Build a new search request
   $request = $sherlock->search();

   //Set the index, type and from/to parameters of the request.
   //The query is at at the end of the chain, although it could be placed anywhere
   $request->index("test")
            ->type("tweet")
            ->from(0)
            ->to(10);
            ->query(Sherlock::query()->Term()->field("message")
                                              ->term("ElasticSearch"));

   //Execute the search and return results
   $response = $request->execute();

   echo "Took: ".$response->took."\r\n";
   echo "Number of Hits: ".count($response)."\r\n";

   //Iterate over the hits and print out some data
   foreach($response as $hit)
   {
      echo $hit['score'].' - '.$hit['source']['message']."\r\n";
   }


   //Let's try a more advanced query now.
   //Each section is it's own variable to help show how everything fits together
   $must = Sherlock::query()->Term()->field("message")
                                     ->term("ElasticSearch");

   $should = Sherlock::query()->Match()->field("author")
                                        ->query("Zachary Tong")
                                        ->boost(2.5);

   $must_not = Sherlock::query()->Term()->field("message")
                                           ->term("Solr");

   $bool = Sherlock::query()->Bool->must($must)
                                   ->should($should)
                                   ->must_not($must_not);
   $request->query($bool);
   $request->execute();


```

Not a fan of ORM style construction?  Don't worry, _Sherlock_ supports "raw" associative arrays
```php
    //Build a new search request
    $request = $sherlock->search();

    //We can compose queries using hashmaps instead of the ORM.
    $manualData = array("field" => "field1", "term" => "town");

    $request->query(Sherlock::query()->Term($manualData));

```

Need to consume and use raw JSON?  No problem
```php
    //Build a new search request
    $request = $sherlock->search();

    //We can compose queries using hashmaps instead of the ORM.
    $json = '{ "term" : { "field1" : "town" } }';

    $request->query(Sherlock::query()->Raw($json));

```

(There will be a RawQuery method soon, that lets you construct entirely arbitrary queries with arrays or JSON)

Philosophy
----------
_Sherlock_ aims to continue the precendent set by ElasticSearch: work out of the box with minimal configuration and provide a simple interface.

_Sherlock's_ API uses a "Fluid" interface that relies heavily on method chaining and type hinting for brevity.  The developer should never need to stop and look up a class name to instantiate, or dig through docs to remember which class accepts which arguments.

Secondary to the interface comes _Sherlock_ developer sanity: reduce code as much as possible.  Rather than write a million getter/setter functions to expose ElasticSearch's various parameters, _Sherlock_ relies heavily upon templates, auto-generated class stubs, magic methods and PHPdoc.
